!! i have installed firefox and qbittorrent, if you belive this to be bloat please remove it !!
-------------------------------------------------
general utilities and gnu core utilities
-------------------------------------------------
sudo pacman -S (package name) to install stuff
you can also use yay -S (DO NOT SUDO!!!)
sudo pacman -R (package name) to uninstall stuff (rns for its unused dependencies)

cd (directory name) to change directories
ls to view contents of the current directories ls -a to show hidden files (you are using lsd or ls developed but there arent really any differences)
mkdir (name) to create directories
rm (filename) to delete a file
rm -rf (directory name) to delete a file
touch(filename) can be used to create a file, i reccomend just using nvim

cat(filename) to print the contents of a file (lolcat if u want it to look cool)
nvim opens your brand new semi-custom neovim config complete with tabs and a file tree and all sorts, nvim(filename) to open a file or create one with that name
yazi is your blazing fast file manager, written in rust.arrow keys to move, enter to open. d to delete y and p to copy/paste, space to select
htop shows system resouce usage,might have to include my settings
pfetch is your fetch script (neofetch looked weird when i tried to make it fit with my colourscheme so i went sudo pacman -R on it)
pipes.sh just plays a cool luh thing
just type firefox to get into your browser, use a mint green theme and a force dark mode addon to fit the theme dont forget ublock origin
git clone and wget are useful for getting stuff from the internet
qbittorrent is for your torrents, pretty self explainitory. piratebay.org is a good place to start, dont download software or porn, you will be infected

just type a programs name to open it and if it was installed with yay or pacman it will open, you can see what will do this in your bin folder
help/man (program name) or (program name) -help should do something if your stuck

python3 (filename) will run a python file
gcc (filename) will compile a c file, g++ for c++. you can run the output or any executeable with ./(filename) gcc defaults to a.out (./a.out)
please always use file extensions for code files as nvim has language support (abc.py abc.cpp abc.c, etc)
-------------------------------------------------
i3 binds.config file at ~/.config/i3/config
-------------------------------------------------
windows (or alt if ur weird i will refer to this key as mod from now on) + enter creates a new terminal window
mod + t creates a new termgpt window
mod + r enters and exits resize mode, arrows to resize
mod + number to move to that workspace
mod + shift + number moves current window to that workspace
mod + arrows to change active window
mod + shift + arrows to move active window
mod + shift + q to close active window
-------------------------------------------------
neovim lazyvim and some random shit i did to the terminal
-------------------------------------------------
if you hit escape on the terminal you get vim keybinds (letters to move V to highlight Y to yank P to paste I for insert etc)

NORMAL NVIM
after escape:
i to insert
:q to quit
:w (filename optional (sometimes)) to save
:wq to save quit
v to enter visual or capital for visual line (highlight)
y to yank (copy)
p to paste
:! to do a shell comand (useful for interpreted languages)

!! IMPORTANT TO LEARN !!
will be reffered to as move letters because i dont know what to call them
h-left j-down k-up l-right

LAZYVIM EXCLUSIVE
if you enter the first letter of a command suggestions will pop up
after escape:
control + move letters to go to different window
shift + move letters for different tab
space + e open file viewer (movement keys and enter to interact)
space + bd to close tab
space + bD to close window (like the file thing)
space + f + n for new file
-------------------------------------------------
maintainance notes
-------------------------------------------------
update regularly (sudo pacman -Syu)
clean regularly(sudo pacman -Sc, sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq))
if your display manager shits itself (you only get a tty) just do: sudo systemctl enable (dm name).i reccomend ly, it has failed me the least.
do not touch your grub config files if you value your data

important config files are located at:
Xterm(your terminal): ~/.Xresources
i3 (your window manager): ~/.config/i3/config
bashrc(your bash prompt and some other stuff like defaults alias's and PATH): ~/.bashrc
neovim(cd to this as there are multiple files): ~/.config/nvim/
grub(dont do it that mint green outline is not worth destroying your bootloader): /boot/grub/grub.cfg
bin(where everything you can open in one command is): /bin/
-------------------------------------------------
have fun, dont give up.
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
